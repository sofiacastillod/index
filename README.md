# Core Code Program Index

## Who is this for?

core-code.io is for those genuinely seeking knowledge. You are passionate about discovering how the world works and are constantly looking for ways to improve your life and others by solving existing problems resourcing to your will, your time, your curiosity, your knowledge, and your tools. 

You understand yourself as part of a whole and you are willing to find your role by looking into your authenticity.

## Principles

- Independence. Learn by being genuinely curious. Ask questions to yourself, then to google, then to others.
- Authenticity. Listen to whatever you feel attracted to and do not be afraid of diving deep. Embrace your self.
- Sharing. Start a conversation, share your discoveries. Find partners that'll make you stronger.
- Quality. You are aware of your responsibilities and know when your assignments are ready. Avoid wasting others' time and only submit things when they meet professional standards. How you care about the quality of your work is how you care about the quality of your life.
- Think before you build. Design it in your head, then proceed. Avoid wasting your time by writing code you'll need to change later. Understand the problem, solve it in your head and then write the code. 
- Integrity. As part of an organization, you'll have access to sensible company and user data. Be wise and responsible. Don't be afraid of communicating any vulnerabilities you've found or that you may have created. Any error can be solved before deploying to production.

## Objective

This program is designed to help you succeed as an independent software developer. By completing this course, you'll begin a life-long journey as an inventor. You will know how to build useful (and profitable) stuff with computer code. You'll understand how to "speak" to a computer and ultimately, employ these technologies to improve certain aspects of your life or any organization's. 

You will also learn how to communicate your ideas professionally. Imagination is futile without putting it to action. First explore, test, prove and then present. 

You will feel comfortable with your code, not only because it works, but because it is eloquent, its performance is optimal, its architecture is well structured and its results are reliable.

## Workflow

core-code.io is designed as if you were already hired by a software company. You'll learn how to use common communication tools such as slack and SCRUM. Common version control tools such as GIT and Github. Common development tools such as the command line and the text editor, common deployment tools, and of course, you'll learn how to program SOLID products utilizing patterns such as TDD and OOP.
